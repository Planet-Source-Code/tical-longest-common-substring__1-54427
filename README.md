### Description

This code shows how to find a longest common substring in two strings.

I had a hard time finding out how exactly to do this so now that I have done it I'm sharing it to help others that need it.
 
### More Info
 
The LongestCommonSubstring function is currently case-insensitive but that can be easily fixed so it is case-sensitive. Also the function will return the first longest common substring it finds if there are two common substrings of the same length.
